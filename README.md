# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## 0-bubble_sort.c
Defines a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm. The array is printed each time two elements are swapped.

## 0-O
Lists the best, average, and worst case big O notation of the Bubble sort algorithm, respectively.

## 1-insertion_sort_list.c
Defines a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

## 1-0
Lists the best, average, and worst case big O notation of the Insertion sort algorithm, respectively.

## 2-selection_sort.c
Defines a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm. The array is printed each time two elements are swapped.

## 2-O
Lists the best, average, and worst case big O notation of the Selection sort algorithm, respectively.

## 3-quick_sort.c
Defines a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm.

## 3-O
Lists the best, average, and worst case big O notation of the Quick sort algorithm, respectively.

## 101-cocktail_sort_list.c
Defines a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Cocktail Shaker sort algorithm. The algorithm remembers where the last actual swap had been done. In each pass, there will be no swaps beyond this limit and the algorithm therefore has shorter passes in each successive iteration.

## 101-O
Lists the best, average, and worst case big O notation of the Cocktail Shaker sort algorithm, respectively.

## 102-counting_sort.c
Defines a function that sorts an array of positive integers in ascending order using the Counting sort algorithm. The counting array is printed once it is set up.

## 102-O
Lists the best, average, and worst case big O notation of the Counting sort algorithm, respectively.
